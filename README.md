# Housing data in Spain

Github Repo including complete series for *most* housing data publicly available in Spain.

## What you will find here
Provide cleaning R-scripts for a comprehensive series of Spanish housing data, including prices indexes, 
rent, touristic apartments, construction, rehabilitation and demographics. 

Data stratification ranges from provinces and autonomous regions to municipalities and even small census units. 

Original data series are provided (see raw data). The folder includes a pdf (when available) explaining the data collection
and other particularities of the data, and then the raw series in .csv or .XLS, as provided by the admin unit.

Scripts in R clean the raw data and make it ready to be used. This includes generating time variables, province
and municipality coding, and other data arrangements so it can be easily merged with other data sources.

Plots provide some .html files deploying some time series. Feel free to modify and update the series at will.
